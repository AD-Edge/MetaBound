# MetaBound_

Entry for the MetaBoy Gamejam, November 2022.
Using three.js (3D graphics) + cannon-es.js (Physics) and a few other libraries - to create some 3D javascript for the first time.

Mostly unfinished, more of a 3D demo than anything else. Some of the roughest code I've ever drop-kicked together. But learnt a stack!
